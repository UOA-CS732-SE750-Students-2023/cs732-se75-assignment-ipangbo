Due to the size limitation of the CANVAS upload file, the video on CANVAS is in 720p. Go to [Youtube](https://youtu.be/Q3W9n6mAmhE) for a higher quality video.

Please follow [Wiki Page](https://github.com/UOA-CS732-SE750-Students-2023/cs732-se75-assignment-ipangbo/wiki) for more information about running demo.

## Introduction

This is a project about the frontend framework. Since the theme named R (written in PHP) used for my WordPress blog ipangbo.cn is no longer compatible with PHP 7.4 and above, I rewrote this theme using Nuxt 3 and the WordPress REST API to replace the PHP version theme that I'm using.

## Acknowledgement

The HTML structure and partial CSS come from the PHP version of the theme. I rewrote all JavaScript/TypeScript with Nuxt and Vue. I own the original theme. The backend of this project is WordPress. For faster loading consideration, some images are linked to the CDN of the university. These images are irrelevant to the content of the website.

## Online Demo

I deployed the web application on [r.ipangbo.cn](https://r.ipangbo.cn).

## Defects and Plans for Correction

Due to time limitations and familiarity with the Nuxt framework, the following features have not been implemented:
- Display comments
- Share to social media
- More styles of article lists

Although the assignment is finished, I will work on this theme continiously. The functionality of this project will eventually surpass the original PHP theme.
